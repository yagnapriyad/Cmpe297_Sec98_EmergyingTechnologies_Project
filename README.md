Objective:

Brain tumor occurs because of anomalous development of cells. It is one of the major reasons of death in adults around the globe. Millions of deaths can be prevented through early detection of brain tumor. Earlier brain tumor detection using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may increase patient's survival rate. In MRI, tumor is shown more clearly that helps in the process of further treatment. This project aims to detect tumor at an early phase.The main purpose of the project is to detect if a person has brain tumor or not using their MRI scans. For this purpose we have implemented different model architectures to understand and perform the detection.

Models:
1. VGG16
2. VGG16 Transfer Learning
3. MobileNet
4. ResNet
5. CNN
